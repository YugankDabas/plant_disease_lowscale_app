#Plant Disease Detection using CNN:
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of plant leaves whether they are healthy or have any type of Disease. It was developed as a learning exercise to explore deep learning, image classification, and model evaluation       techniques.

#Key Features:
-Dataset: Plant_Disease_Recognition (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/plant-disease-recognition-dataset)
-Framework: TensorFlow and Keras
-Accuracy: Achieved a classification accuracy of 91.92%

#Contents:
-Data preprocessing and augmentation
-Custom CNN architecture design and training
-Model evaluation and testing
